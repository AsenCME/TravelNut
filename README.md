# TravelNut

We are nuts for travel.

## Idea

Write out your travel bucket list and get trip suggestions. Check off all your destinations. Complete fun scavenger hunts and travel challenges. Compete with your friends. Let the app to guide you through visiting all of them.

## Inspiration

We want to upgrade travel. We want to create a new way of experiencing vacations.

## Implementation

We have used Adobe XD to create the application interface. In the future we will use Flutter to implement the UI. As for the information inside the app, we plan on using available data sets which include travel tendencies of different control groups. Web scraping can be a powerful tool for us to find the best possible trips available, or even a partnership with an existing service that provides trip consulting.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was combining our separate skill-sets and narrowing our ideas down to something that maximizes our potential and showcases our talents.
